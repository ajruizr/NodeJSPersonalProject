# NodeJSPersonalProject
This is an activity of Nodejs where we connect database with client and server.

REMEMBER: 
-First execute the SQL statements in your database and to connect properly please change api/db/context/db.js values to your database setup.
-Secondly, rememeber to install your node modules require, you can just simple run "npm install" on your terminal.

ONCE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING READY:
 ̶P̶l̶e̶a̶s̶e̶ ̶p̶o̶p̶u̶l̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶a̶b̶l̶e̶ ̶t̶a̶s̶k̶ (added function to populate it in html), then you can open your localhost:9000 where every task is shown, remember that if you press the delete button it will be deleted in database too, be very careful with that
