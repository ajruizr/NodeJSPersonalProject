# NodeJSPersonalProject
This is an activity of Nodejs where we connect database with client and server.

REMEMBER: First execute the SQL statements in your database and to connect properly please change api/db/context/db.js values to your database setup.

ONCE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING READY:
Please populate the table task, then you can open your localhost:9000 where every task is shown, remember that if you press the delete button it will be deleted in database too, be very careful with that
